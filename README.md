## Overview

SonataCraft is a site where you can re-live the glory days of the baroque era, by playing a digital piano with that classic piano sound. **(To be implemented)->** The user can also practice sheet music, with the included sheet staff that displays the played notes.

This project was created as a part of the September-24 Hackathon, hosted by Code Institute.
